                    UDYAM is the annual techno-management fest of Electronics Engineering Department, IIT BHU, Varanasi. Synonymous with technical know-how and management acumen, Udyam is about practical application of classroom knowledge. With this idea of application oriented approach UDYAM started.It’s not just these neck-to-neck competitions that you can get at UDYAM. It’s also about the whacky novel contraptions created here that go far beyond the fest. Internships. Patents. All happens. UDYAM sets the stage free for you. Spotlight is on you. Just go with it. We promise after the three days of fest , you will leave with lot of passion to innovate and excel.

                    UDYAM started in 2010 with the aim of providing a platform for the Indian student community to develop and showcase their technical prowess. For the last 11 years, UDYAM has constantly grown, evolved, and pushed the boundaries of what a branch fest can be. This year marks the 12th Edition of UDYAM, IIT (BHU) Varanasi. The fest shall be conducted online from April, 2021, whereas, some events will be conducted at the beautiful, green campus of IIT (BHU) Varanasi, India when the institute reopens. Boasting of a huge roster of exciting and engaging events, this edition of UDYAM promises to be grander, greater and more glorious than ever before.
